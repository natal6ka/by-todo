<h2>Todo app build using twitter.bootstrap+angular.js+node.js+mongodb</h2>

This app was built in one day. Also, I started to learn Angular.js three days before I started building Todo app.

I hosted the app in Nodejitsu with Mongolab database.

This is the link - <a href="http://by-todo.nodejitsu.com" target="_blank">by-todo app</a>.

Now it has some bugs. It is a dirty variant yet and I need to add some features. But I plan to add user registration functionality to make more usable.

So, if you like it, fork me :) and if you have any suggestions or comments please contact me at uc2pac@gmail.com.
