<h2>Todo app build using twitter.bootstrap+angular.js+node.js+mongodb</h2>

This app was build in one day.
Also I started to learn Angular.js three days before I start building Todo app.

I hosted the app in Nodejitsu hosting with Mongolab database.

This is the link - <a href="http://by-world-todo.nodejitsu.com" target="_blank">by-todo app</a>.

Now it has some bugs. It is dirty variant yet and I need to add some fitures. But I plan to add users to make it available for everyone.

So, if you like it fork me :) and if you have any suggestions or comments please contact me at uc2pac@gmail.com.
